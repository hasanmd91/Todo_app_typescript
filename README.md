# Task organizer App


This is a  to-do list application that allows users to create and store tasks locally in their browser. The application uses HTML, CSS, and TypeScript.

The application consists of a form with input fields for task title, date, and description. Users can submit a task by filling out the form and clicking the "Add" button. The task is then added to a list of tasks displayed on the page.

Users can edit and delete tasks from the list. Each task in the list displays its title, date, and description, and includes options to edit or delete the task.

The application uses an array to store tasks, and uses local storage to persist the tasks across page reloads. When the page is loaded, it retrieves any tasks stored in local storage and displays them in the list.
